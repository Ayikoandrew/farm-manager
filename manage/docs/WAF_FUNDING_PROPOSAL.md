## The Problem

### Current Situation for Smallholder Livestock Farmers

Smallholder farmers in Uganda face persistent challenges in managing their livestock operations:

**Lack of Record Keeping**: Most farmers rely on memory or informal paper records to track their animals. This leads to:
- Missed breeding cycles and vaccinations
- Lost income from animals that die preventably
- Inability to identify which animals or practices are most profitable
- No verifiable records for loan applications or insurance

**Limited Access to Information**: Farmers lack access to:
- Market prices and optimal selling times
- Health and breeding best practices
- Weather and climate information relevant to their livestock

**Financial Exclusion**: Without formal records:
- Banks and microfinance institutions cannot assess creditworthiness
- Farmers cannot demonstrate the value of their livestock as collateral
- Insurance products remain inaccessible

**Technology Gap**: Existing farm management solutions are:
- Designed for large commercial operations with IT support
- Too expensive for smallholder farmers
- Require constant internet connectivity unavailable in rural areas
- Available only in English, excluding many local farmers

### Impact of the Problem

- Uganda's livestock sector contributes approximately 4.3% to GDP but operates far below its potential
- Preventable animal deaths cost farmers an estimated 20-30% of potential income
- Lack of data prevents evidence-based agricultural policy and intervention
- Rural farmers remain trapped in poverty cycles despite having productive assets

## Why Funding is Necessary

### Service and Infrastructure Costs

Farm Manager relies on several cloud services that require ongoing funding:

#### Google Gemini AI API (AI Assistant)
The virtual farm assistant uses Google's Gemini AI to enable farmers to interact with the app using natural language. Unlike traditional interfaces, farmers can simply say "remind me to vaccinate the pigs tomorrow" or "show me all pregnant cattle."

**Cost Structure**: Google charges per token (unit of text processed). Each conversation includes:
- The user's question
- Context about their farm and animals
- System instructions for understanding agricultural terminology
- The AI's response

As usage scales across hundreds or thousands of farmers, API costs grow proportionally. Without funding, we would need to limit this feature or charge farmers directly, defeating the purpose of making technology accessible to those who need it most.

#### Supabase (Database and Backend)
Supabase provides:
- PostgreSQL database for storing all farm data
- Real-time synchronization across devices
- Authentication and security
- File storage for animal photos and documents

The free tier supports limited users. A production deployment requires a paid plan to ensure reliability, security, and capacity for growing user base.

#### FastAPI Backend Deployment
The machine learning models for weight prediction, health risk assessment, and breeding optimization require a backend server running FastAPI. Deployment costs include:
- Cloud server hosting (AWS, Google Cloud, or similar)
- Model training compute resources
- API gateway and load balancing for reliability

#### Flutterwave Payment Processing
Flutterwave enables mobile money integration but charges transaction fees:
- Per-transaction fees for mobile money operations
- Monthly platform fees for business accounts
- Webhook hosting for payment notifications

### Development Priorities Requiring Funding

#### 1. Offline-First Architecture (High Priority)
Rural farmers often lack reliable internet. Building a complete offline-first system requires:
- Local database implementation (SQLite/Isar)
- Sync engine with conflict resolution

- Breeding optimization (optimal breeding timing)
- Feed optimization (reduce waste, improve efficiency)

**Requirements**:
- Cloud compute for model training
- Data collection and labeling
- Model optimization for on-device inference
- Continuous monitoring and retraining

#### 3. Localization (Medium Priority)

- Bluetooth livestock scales (auto weight logging)
- RFID readers (animal identification)
- IoT environmental sensors (temperature, humidity)

**Requirements**:
- Hardware procurement for testing
- Driver development and testing
- Integration with diverse device types

### Field Deployment Costs
